<h3 style="font-size: 18px;">ConfessionWeb</h3>
<h3 style="font-size: 18px;">UNIVERSAL TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT</h3>
<i><p>Last Revised: June 14, 2018</p></i>

<h3 style="font-size: 18px;">PLEASE READ THIS UNIVERSAL TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY, AS IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.</h3>
<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">1. OVERVIEW</h3>

<p style="color: black;">This Universal Terms of Service Agreement (this “Agreement”) is entered into by and between ConfessionWeb and you, and is made effective as of the date of your use of this website ("Site") or the date of electronic acceptance. This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the Site and the products and services purchased or accessed through this Site (individually and collectively, the “Services”), and is in addition to (not in lieu of) any specific terms and conditions that apply to the particular Services. This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.<br><br>

The terms “we”, “us” or “our” shall refer to Rendered. The terms “you”, “your”, “User” or “customer” shall refer to any individual or entity who accepts this Agreement, has access to your account or uses the Services. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.<br><br>

ConfessionWeb may, in its sole and absolute discretion, change or modify this Agreement, and any policies or agreements which are incorporated herein, at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting to this Site. Your use of this Site or the Services after such changes or modifications have been made shall constitute your acceptance of this Agreement as last revised. If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement as last revised, do not use (or continue to use) this Site or the Services. In addition, ConfessionWeb may occasionally notify you of changes or modifications to this Agreement by email. It is therefore very important that you keep your shopper account (“Account”) information current. ConfessionWeb assumes no liability or responsibility for your failure to receive an email notification if such failure results from an inaccurate email address. In addition, ConfessionWeb may terminate Your use of Services for any violation or breach of any of the terms of this Agreement by You.<br><br>

The information provided by the users shall not be served to any of the outer entities and not be used by the ConfessionWeb to provide any of the services to the users.
</p>
<br>


<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">2. Use of Cookies</h3>

<p style="color: black;">The ConfessionWeb use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize ConfessionWeb pages, or register with ConfessionWeb or services, a cookie helps ConfessionWeb to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same ConfessionWeb site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the ConfessionWeb features that you customized.<br><br>
Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the ConfessionWeb services or Web sites you visit.</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">3. How we protect your information</h3>

<p style="color: black;">The security of your information is important to us. ConfessionWeb has implemented safeguards to protect the information we collect. However, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal data safe, such as choosing strong password and keeping it private, as well as logging out of your user account, and closing your web browser when finished using the ConfessionWeb Platform.</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">4. Your Choices</h3>

<p style="color: black;">You may, of course, decline to submit information through the ConfessionWeb Platform, in which case we may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may also control the types of notifications and communications we send, limit the information shared within the ConfessionWeb Platform about you, and otherwise amend certain privacy settings.</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">5. Transferring Your Data</h3>

<p style="color: black;">ConfessionWeb is headquartered in the Canada, and has operations, entities and service providers in the Canada and throughout the world. As such, we and our service providers may transfer your personal data to, or access it in, jurisdictions (including the Canada) that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it, including through appropriate written data processing terms and/or data transfer agreements.</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">6. What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?
</h3>

<p style="color: black;">When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, phone number or other details to help you with your experience.</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">7. When do we collect information?
</h3>

</h3>

<p style="color: black;">We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:<br><br>

• To personalize your experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.<br>

• To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests.<br>
• To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature.<br>

</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">9. How do we protect your information?
</h3>

<p style="color: black;">We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards.<br>
We only provide articles and information. We never ask for credit card numbers.
We use regular Malware Scanning.<br><br>

Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.<br><br>

We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.<br><br>

All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.</p>

<br>


<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">10. Do we use 'cookies'?
</h3>

<p style="color: black;">Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.<br><br>

We use cookies to:<br>
• Understand and save user's preferences for future visits.<br>
• Keep track of advertisements.<br>
• Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.<br><br>

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since browser is a little different, look at your browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.
</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">11. Third-party disclosure
</h3>

<p style="color: black;">We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when it's release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety.<br><br>

However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">12. Third-party links
</h3>

<p style="color: black;">We do not include or offer third-party products or services on our website.
</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">13. California Online Privacy Protection Act
</h3>

<p style="color: black;">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: <a href="https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">Here</a>

According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:<br>
Users can visit our site anonymously.<br>
Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.<br>
Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.<br><br>

You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:<br>
• On our Privacy Policy Page<br>
Can change your personal information:
• By logging in to your account  <br>

</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">14. How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?
</h3>

<p style="color: black;">We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">15. Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?
</h3>

<p style="color: black;">It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.
</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">16. COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
</h3>

<p style="color: black;">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br><br>

We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">17. Fair Information Practices
</h3>

<p style="color: black;">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<br><br>

In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:<br>
We will notify you via email<br>
• Within 1 business day<br>
We will notify the users via in-site notification
• Within 1 business day<br><br>

We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
</p>


<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">18. CAN SPAM Act
</h3>

<p style="color: black;">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.<br><br>

We collect your email address in order to:<br>
• Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions<br><br>

To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:<br>
• Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.<br>
• Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.<br>
• Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.
• Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
• Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly. • Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.
</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">19. CONTACT INFORMATION
</h3>

<p style="color: black;">If you have any questions about this Agreement, please contact us by email address at:<br><br>

<a href="mailto:info@confessionweb.com">info@confessionweb.com</a>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">20. Changes to Our Privacy Policy
</h3>

<p style="color: black;">If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on this page. If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy that materially change how we treat your personal information, we will endeavor to provide you with reasonable notice of such changes, such as via prominent notice in the ConfessionWeb Platform or to your email address of record, and where required by law, we will obtain your consent or give you the opportunity to opt out of such changes.<br><br>
